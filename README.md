# HelloEmbeddedCpp

This repository contains my very first C++ programs as part of my learning journey towards **Embedded Systems and Object-Oriented Programming**.

## Contents
- `hello.cpp` → Prints "Hello Embedded C++ World!"
- `variables.cpp` → Demonstrates usage of basic C++ data types (int, double, char, bool).
- `operators.cpp` → Shows arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators in C++.

## How to Compile & Run
```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello

g++ variables.cpp -o variables
./variables

g++ operators.cpp -o operators
./operators
